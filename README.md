# Library for the ST7735S display driver

## Demonstration

![display][display_image]

## Architecture

![library architecture][architecture_image]

This library is an abstraction. To use it, you need to implement functions that will handle communication with the display driver. The header file contains a signature and description of these functions. The implementation itself is very easy. The source code includes an implementation example for Wiring Pi based on the 4-line SPI. After implementing these functions, you need to link them to the library code into your program. This architecture allows this library to be used with a wide range of devices.

If you need to use this library with a parallel interface, you have to rewrite the functions for sending data and drawing. The code is made so simply that this re-implementation will be easy.

The library code has been created in such a way that it can be easily changed to support similar display drivers. Therefore, optimal size variables were used. If you need to minimize the use of operating memory, you can: reduce the size of the variables that store the dimensions of the display and get rid of the pointers. The code will become less flexible but more suited for a specific device.

By using the pointer, you can easily and quickly switch to another display module and draw on it.

The library code is made in the ANSI C standard (X3.159-1989).
